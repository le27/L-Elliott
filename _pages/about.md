I am a PhD student in pure mathematics and part of the [analysis research group](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/) at the University of St Andrews.

My current research is on fractal geometry and related fields in analysis, supervised by [Dr Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/) and
[Professor Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/), and funded by a scholarship from the [Carnegie Trust](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/).

I love engaging in outreach and giving talks to both specialist and general audiences. If you'd be interested in having me speak at an event, please get in touch.
