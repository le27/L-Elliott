I am a PhD student in pure mathematics and part of the [algebra research group](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/pg/pure/Algebra/) at the University of St Andrews.

My current research is supervised by [Dr Collin Bleak](http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~collin/) and
[Dr James D. Mitchell](http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/).

The drawing is of Kobayashi from [小林さんちのメイドラゴン](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Kobayashi%27s_Dragon_Maid) expressing my opinion that the empty set with the empty binary operation should be considered a group.
 Although the most common definition of group requires an identity, there are many other definitions of a group which are equivalent in all other cases but also allow for the empty group (I beleive many of these definitions are more natural than the generally accepted one).
 To my knowledge, Kobayashi's opinions on this matter are unknown.
